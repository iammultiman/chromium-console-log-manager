# Testing the Console Log Extension Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **SensitiveDataDetector not defined**: Fixed model loading and export issues
2. **Required models not loaded**: Added proper model availability checking
3. **ErrorHandler "[object Object]" issue**: Improved error logging with JSON serialization
4. **Settings & logs interface not working**: Fixed tab navigation and log loading

## How to Test

### 1. Load the Extension
1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode"
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `console-log-extension/dist` folder
4. The extension should load without errors

### 2. Test the Options Page
1. Right-click the extension icon and select "Options"
2. The options page should load without errors
3. Check the browser console (F12) for any error messages

### 3. Expected Console Output
When the options page loads successfully, you should see:
```
All required models loaded successfully
Options page initialized successfully
```

### 4. Test Tab Navigation
1. Click on different tabs (Logs, Settings, Export, Storage)
2. Each tab should switch properly
3. No JavaScript errors should appear in console

### 5. Test Log Display
1. Go to the "Logs" tab
2. If you have captured logs, they should display
3. If no logs, you should see "No logs found matching your criteria"

### 6. Test Settings Tab
1. Go to the "Settings" tab
2. All form controls should be visible and functional
3. Try changing settings and clicking "Save Settings"

## Debugging

If you still see errors:

1. **Check Console**: Open browser console (F12) and look for error messages
2. **Model Loading**: Look for "Missing required models" messages
3. **Background Script**: Check if background script is running properly

## Common Issues

### "SensitiveDataDetector is not defined"
- This should be fixed with the model loading improvements
- Check if all script tags are loading in the HTML

### "Required models not loaded"
- Check browser console for which specific models are missing
- Verify all script files exist in the dist folder

### Tab navigation not working
- Check if click event listeners are being attached
- Look for JavaScript errors in console

### No logs showing
- Check if background script is running
- Verify console logs are being captured on web pages
- Check Chrome extension permissions

## Next Steps

If issues persist:
1. Check the browser console for specific error messages
2. Verify the extension has proper permissions
3. Test on a simple webpage to capture console logs
4. Check if the background script is receiving messages properly
