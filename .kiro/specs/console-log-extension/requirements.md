# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Chrome extension that provides comprehensive console log management capabilities. The extension will capture, organize, store, and allow users to search through console logs from web pages, addressing the gap in existing solutions that lack persistent organized storage, advanced search functionality, and session-based organization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to automatically capture console logs from web pages, so that I can review debugging information without keeping DevTools open constantly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a web page loads THEN the extension SHALL automatically start capturing all console.log, console.error, console.warn, and console.info messages
2. WHEN console messages are generated THEN the extension SHALL capture the timestamp, log level, message content, and source URL
3. WHEN the extension is disabled THEN the system SHALL stop capturing new console logs
4. WHEN the extension is re-enabled THEN the system SHALL resume capturing console logs without losing previous data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want console logs organized by website and session, so that I can easily find logs related to specific debugging scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN console logs are captured THEN the system SHALL group them by domain/website automatically
2. WHEN a new browser session starts for a website THEN the system SHALL create a new session group with timestamp
3. WHEN viewing stored logs THEN the system SHALL display them organized by website with expandable session groups
4. WHEN multiple tabs of the same website are open THEN the system SHALL group logs by tab session

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to search and filter through historical console logs, so that I can quickly find specific error messages or debugging information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching logs THEN the system SHALL support text search across all log messages
2. WHEN filtering logs THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by log level (error, warn, info, log)
3. WHEN filtering logs THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by date range
4. WHEN filtering logs THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by specific website/domain
5. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL highlight matching text in the results

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to export console logs in various formats, so that I can share debugging information with team members or include it in bug reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting logs THEN the system SHALL support JSON format export
2. WHEN exporting logs THEN the system SHALL support CSV format export
3. WHEN exporting logs THEN the system SHALL support plain text format export
4. WHEN exporting logs THEN the system SHALL allow exporting filtered/searched results only
5. WHEN exporting logs THEN the system SHALL include all metadata (timestamp, level, source, session info)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want persistent storage of console logs with automatic cleanup, so that I can access historical debugging information without running out of storage space.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logs are captured THEN the system SHALL store them persistently using Chrome's storage API
2. WHEN storage approaches limits THEN the system SHALL automatically remove oldest logs based on configurable retention policy
3. WHEN configuring retention THEN the system SHALL allow setting maximum storage size and/or age limits
4. WHEN logs are stored THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity across browser restarts
5. IF storage quota is exceeded THEN the system SHALL notify the user and provide cleanup options

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a user-friendly interface to view and manage console logs, so that I can efficiently navigate through captured debugging information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN opening the extension popup THEN the system SHALL display a summary of recent log activity
2. WHEN accessing the full interface THEN the system SHALL provide a dedicated page with comprehensive log management
3. WHEN viewing logs THEN the system SHALL display them with proper syntax highlighting and formatting
4. WHEN managing logs THEN the system SHALL provide options to clear logs for specific websites or sessions
5. WHEN using the interface THEN the system SHALL provide intuitive navigation between different websites and sessions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure extension settings, so that I can customize the log capture behavior according to my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the extension THEN the system SHALL allow enabling/disabling log capture for specific websites
2. WHEN configuring the extension THEN the system SHALL allow setting which log levels to capture (error, warn, info, log)
3. WHEN configuring the extension THEN the system SHALL allow setting storage retention policies
4. WHEN configuring the extension THEN the system SHALL allow setting maximum number of logs per session
5. WHEN settings are changed THEN the system SHALL apply them immediately without requiring browser restart

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to capture console logs based on specific keywords or phrases, so that I can focus only on relevant debugging information and reduce noise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring keyword filters THEN the system SHALL allow adding multiple keywords or phrases to capture
2. WHEN configuring keyword filters THEN the system SHALL allow adding multiple keywords or phrases to ignore/exclude
3. WHEN keyword filters are active THEN the system SHALL only capture logs containing at least one of the specified inclusion keywords
4. WHEN exclusion keywords are set THEN the system SHALL ignore logs containing any of the specified exclusion keywords
5. WHEN keyword matching THEN the system SHALL support case-sensitive and case-insensitive matching options
6. WHEN keyword filters are disabled THEN the system SHALL capture all logs according to other configured settings
7. WHEN multiple keyword filters are set THEN the system SHALL apply inclusion filters first, then exclusion filters

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to handle sensitive data securely, so that I can use it safely without risking exposure of confidential information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN capturing logs THEN the system SHALL store all data locally using Chrome's secure storage APIs only
2. WHEN capturing logs THEN the system SHALL never transmit log data to external servers or third parties
3. WHEN detecting potential sensitive data patterns THEN the system SHALL provide optional filtering to exclude logs containing common sensitive patterns (API keys, passwords, tokens)
4. WHEN exporting logs THEN the system SHALL warn users about potential sensitive data in exports
5. WHEN the extension is uninstalled THEN the system SHALL provide option to automatically clear all stored log data
6. WHEN accessing stored data THEN the system SHALL only allow access from the extension's own context
7. WHEN requesting permissions THEN the extension SHALL request only the minimum necessary permissions for functionality
